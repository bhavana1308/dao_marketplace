# Java Online Marketplace Project

## Overview

This Java project, as part of Java learning homework from my mentor, revolves around a online market place, covering a range of topics such as Java programming, database design, MyBatis framework and software architecture. 

## Project Structure

### Database Design and SQL

#### Topics Explored:
- Relational database design
- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Primary Key and Foreign Key relationships
- MySQL types to Java types mapping
- Workbench documentation

#### Practical Task:
- Created a database schema using MySQL Workbench with at least 12 tables satisfying the 3 Normal Forms.

### SQL and Database Operations

#### Topics Explored:
- Different database types and their distinctions
- Primary and Foreign keys
- Actions on delete/update
- Database relations
- Column types and their representation for Java types

#### Homework Tasks:
- Executed various SQL operations including insertion, updating, deletion, and joins.
- Implemented SQL statements with different types of joins, aggregate functions, and group by clauses.

### JDBC and DAO Patterns

#### Topics Explored:
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- Data Access Object (DAO) pattern
- Transactions in JDBC
- Differences between Statement and PrepareStatement
- ResultSet in JDBC

#### Homework Tasks:
- Created DAO classes with necessary interfaces, abstract classes, and generics.
- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC.
- Established a service layer for flexibility in switching between databases and frameworks.

### XML Parsing and JAXB

#### Topics Explored:
- XML parsing using StAX, SAX, and DOM
- XML Schema Definition (XSD)
- JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding)

#### Homework Tasks:
- Created an XML file and XSD schema for at least 5 classes from the hierarchy.
- Validated the XML file using XSD schema and an assigned parser.
- Parsed the XML file using one of the parsers.

### JSON Parsing with Jackson

#### Topics Explored:
- JSON syntax
- Jackson library for JSON parsing
- Jackson annotations

#### Homework Tasks:
- Created a JSON file for at least 5 classes from the hierarchy.
- Added Jackson's annotations to the hierarchy, covering Date, List, and complex objects.
- Parsed JSON using Jackson.

### MyBatis Integration

#### Topics Explored:
- MyBatis framework
- XML and annotation-based approaches in MyBatis
- Custom mapping of SQL result set
- Mapping inner custom objects/collections with MyBatis

#### Homework Tasks:
- Added MyBatis DAOs to the existing hierarchy with XML or interface mapping.
- Switched service classes to use MyBatis for database interactions.

## Design Patterns and SOLID Principles

### Topics Explored:
- SOLID principles
- Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Listener, Facade, Decorator, Proxy, Strategy, MVC patterns

### Homework Tasks:
- Added various design patterns (Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, etc.) to the current project.
- Refactored code to adhere to SOLID principles.
